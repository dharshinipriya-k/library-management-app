Library Management Application:

    In this application list of books and their author details have been fetched
     by interacting with mockapi by using AXIOS. 
    
    And additionaly FORMIK and YUP packages have been used in order to ease 
    form validations.

    Proper routing have been provided in order to navigate to various components:
        /dashboard,
        /books,
        /author,
        /create-book,
        /create-author,
        /edit-book/id,
        /edit-author/id

    CRUD features have also been implemented where the user can create, 
    update, delete either the book details or author details.
